README: Synthesis of plant-associate population structure
========================

This repository contains data and scripts supporting a project by the [Yoder Lab](http://lab.jbyoder.org), synthesizing data on the population genetic structure of plants and closely associated species.

This file is the README, which contains an explanation of the repository contents. It's written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown), a form of text markup that is readable as plaintext, but can be interpreted into formated rich text or HTML by various readers, including the GitHub website. It's pretty brief right now but should be fleshed out before a preprint is posted.


Directory structure and contents
--------------------------------

These are the major contents and subdirectories of the project folder. Add or delete and modify as necessary.

- `plant-assoc-synthesis.md`: project notes, ongoing, in markdown
- `scripts`: shell scripts and other languages; all of these are in R so far, so we're not differentiating more than that
- `data`: baseline data, in some cases cleaned and organized for analysis
- `output`: analysis results, both retained intermediate data files
	- `figures`: figures
